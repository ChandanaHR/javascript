<!--Variables
JavaScript variables are used to store data that can be changed later on. 
These variables can be thought of as named containers-->

<!--Furthermore, 
you can use the var keyword to declare the variables as shown below.-->

<!--Variable scope
The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined.
Global Variables : A global variable has global scope which means 
it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.
Local Variables : A local variable will be visible only within a function where 
it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.-->

<!--let statement: Used to declare a variable that is block scoped
The main reason behind introducing the let keyword is to improve the 
scoping behaviors of variables and the safety of the code.-->

<!--Javascript block scope - function scope: The scope of the variable declared with 
the let keyword is a block-scope. It means if you define the variable with the let keyword 
in the specific block, you can access the variable inside that particular block only, and 
if you try to access the variable outside the block, it raises an error like 'variable is not defined'.-->

<!--var keyword: The var keyword has a function scope, meaning if you define the variable using the var keyword in 
any function block, you can access it throughout the function.-->

<!--Redeclaring varibles in Javascript: You can't redeclare the variables declared with the let keyword in the same block. However, you can declare the variables 
with the same name into the different blocks with the same function.
But with var keyword redeclaration is possible-->
